## DISCO:
- My browser can block cookies but cannot remove them, the cookie still exists but for some reason the server cannot read it
- in this iteration, you can have an already existing cookie without a password, it will log you in
- redirect_url directs the user to the given route
- url_for allows you to input the function name instead of the route definition

## QCC:
- How can you store the secret key secretly (not in the python file or sql database)
- what other ways can cookies be used (this cookie is called 'session' what other flask specific cookies are there)
