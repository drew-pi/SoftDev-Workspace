Alert leads to a pop up on the webpage

If there is a hierarchy in the html (DOM) like <div> <ol> <li> Text </li> </ol> </div>, 
it will start from the very inside in this case <li></li>, then <ol></ol>, then <div></div>
by default at least

When you add a true boolean as the third parameter to addEventListener, it completely flips the order upside down
addEventListener('click', function, true); ---> it goes <div></div>, <ol></ol>, then <li></li>
However messing with which ones have the true boolean will change the order

e.stopPropogation() will stop the pop up from coming up, will stop all succeeding events to be triggered

When we do the default (without boolean or with a false as the third parameter) it is called Bubbling because it "propagates upward through its ancestors after being handled by the event's target"
 - so it goes from <li></li> outwards towards the root in this case <div></div>

When we add the true variable it is called Capturing where it goes the other way starting at the ancestor and propagating down to the descendant nodes
- so goes from <div></div> down to <li></li> eventually
