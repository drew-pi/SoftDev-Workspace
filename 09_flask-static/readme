notes:
When you do http: ... /static/foo, so try to open a text file it tells you to download that file 
It also gives a strange response (304), which isn't 200 or 400, for worked and didn't work

html is served and displayed like html not plain text, that's why you are not prompted to download the file when its opened

also a browser probably can't render plain text that's why it tells us to download and open with something that already downloaded on our computer


disco:
when you add folders they end up as another route in your local website

so you can access files in a folder called static at 5000/static/file.html

also it does not seem like a browser can serve plain text formats, only 
html


qcc:
why doesn't the browser display text files, since even text in html is written in plain text format

are some folder names already taken? like some variable names in python are already taken
