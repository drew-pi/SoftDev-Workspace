For buttons to work, the <script></script> element must be below, otherwise cannot read the elements

Very easy to input text and manipulate it in javascript



QCC 


No idea what event listener does, does it execute automatically? Shouldn't but in my tests it does

what is the difference between let and var

still have no idea what the DOM gives me, like I understand what it looks like visually but why is it important in any way
